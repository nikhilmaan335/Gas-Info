            <div class="answer" id="answer1">
                Ans: The expiry date of an LPG (liquefied petroleum gas) cylinder is typically stamped on its neck or

            </div>
            <div class="answer" id="answer2">
                Ans: LPG cylinders have an expiry date primarily for safety reasons. Over time, the integrity of the
                cylinder may degrade due to wear and tear, leading to potential safety hazards. Hence, it's
                essential to
                replace old cylinders with new ones to ensure safe usage.

            <div class="answer" id="answer3">
                Ans:Using an LPG cylinder beyond its expiry date can pose serious safety risks. The cylinder may
                develop
                leaks or other structural weaknesses, increasing the likelihood of accidents such as explosions
                or
                fires. It's crucial to replace expired cylinders promptly.

            <div class="answer" id="answer4">
                Ans: The expiry date is typically stamped on the cylinder's neck or shoulder, near the
                valve. It is

                It's safer
                and more practical to replace expired cylinders with new ones from authorized dealers.

            <div class="answer" id="answer8">
                Ans: It's not recommended to use an LPG cylinder past its expiry date, even if
                it
                appears to
                be in good
                condition. Safety standards dictate that cylinders should be replaced promptly
                upon
                expiration to
                mitigate potential risks.

                <section onclick="toggleAnswer(9)"><i class="fa-solid fa-plus"></i></section>
            </div>
            <div class="answer" id="answer9">
                Ans: When purchasing LPG cylinders, check the expiry date stamped on the
                cylinder to
                ensure
                that it has
                a
                significant remaining lifespan, preferably close to the manufacturing date. This
                ensures
                that you get
                the most out of your purchase in terms of usage duration.

                or
                damage on the
                cylinder should be taken seriously and may warrant closer inspection or
                replacement,
                regardless of the
                expiry date. Regular maintenance and visual inspections are essential
                for safe LPG usage.
